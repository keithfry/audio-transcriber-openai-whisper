- I want to create a python project that takes audio input from the microphone, does speech to text, displays the text, then prompts the user if they want to continue transcribing. If they answer yes it will repeat the process until they say no or hit ctrl-c to cancel. use libraries from hugging face including the openai/whisper-large-v3 model for transcribing audio. make sure that the audio input from the microphone is converted to the correct sampling rate for the whisper model. also make sure that we can take input longer than 30 seconds, meaning you may have to chunk up the audio to support the maximum audio length. create using uv with a virtual environment
